1) Find number of paths through a binary tree 
that sum up to the given target.

2) 3 sum with duplicates. 
You need to get the value from stdin.  

3) s = [abcdef,ghij,klmnop]
(there can be many rows like this)
w be [3,4,4]
Result would be:
abc|ghij|klmn|
def| |op |
first question was to print this. 
Then a W was given, 
create w array such that height of max row is minimized.

4) New stock prices are coming every hour, 
Design a data structure to store stock prices 
and getMaxStock() to get Max stock at price 
at that instance for last K hours. 
K will be known since beginning. 
Stock prices may not come every hour.
