I find the company's mission to be very useful in 
learning about finances.

I've been growing an interest in investing because
I am in a good point in my life where I can start
investing.

Knowing that LC is a peer to peer lending service,
I think I can end up learning about this type of investments.

I also heard the work culture at LC is very good.
